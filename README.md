# A Better Approach!
Everything in life requires some changes...
So does this code.

I created this code when I was new to this field—unaware of all the functions and just trying to make it work with basic logic. That approach was never ideal, but for a newbie, seeing their code actually work was an amazing experience.

It made me feel like I could do something in this field, all because of these 175 lines of code.
But now, I can change it—make it more efficient, cleaner, and better.

I hope that whenever I read this in the future, I’ll feel that something even greater is still waiting for me to achieve.
